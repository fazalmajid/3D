# 3D
Various 3D printing projects:

* `ikea_holder.stl` a little clip for an IKEA NOT uplighter lamp to hold a
  laptop charging plug. First-world problem, I know.

* `penholder.stl` a simple stand to hold a fountain pen on a flat surface so it
  doesn't roll over.

* `vortexbox.{scad,stl}` a box to hold my [Vortex Dome](https://physicshack.com/product/vortex-dome/).

  Just about fits on my Prusa i3 MK3S (you need to go into advanced settings
  and set the skirt loops option to 0, as a skirt would not fit within the
  21x25cm work area). Print using PETG, 0.2mm Quality for best results.
* `zeiss_ep.stl` eyepiece cover for the Zeiss Victory Pocket 8x25 binoculars.

  Use PETG at the 0.10mm Detail setting.
* `zeiss_obj.stl` objective cover for the Zeiss Victory Pocket 8x25 binoculars.

  Use PETG at the 0.10mm Detail setting.
