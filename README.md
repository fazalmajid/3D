# 3D
Various 3D printing projects:

* `vortexbox.scad` a box to hold my [Vortex Dome](https://physicshack.com/product/vortex-dome/)

  Just about fits on my Prusa i3 MK3S (you need to go into advanced settings
  and set the skirt loops option to 0, as a skirt would not fit within the
  21x25cm work area). Print using PETG, 0.2mm Quality for best results.
